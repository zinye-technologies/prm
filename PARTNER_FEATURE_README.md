## Business Logic

### Partner Lifecycle

1. **Registration** → Partner applies through portal or is manually created
2. **Approval** → Internal review and approval process
3. **Onboarding** → Training, certification, and setup
4. **Activation** → Portal access enabled, lead assignment begins
5. **Performance Tracking** → Ongoing monitoring and scoring
6. **Renewal/Termination** → Agreement management

### Performance Scoring

Partners are scored on a 100-point scale:
- **Revenue Performance (40 points)**: Based on total revenue generated
- **Lead Conversion (30 points)**: Conversion rate percentage
- **Training & Certification (20 points)**: Completion status
- **Agreement Compliance (10 points)**: Status and agreement validity

### Automatic Calculations

The system automatically calculates:
- Total deals closed and revenue generated
- Average deal size and lead conversion rates
- Year-to-date performance metrics
- Partner score based on multiple factors
- Commission amounts for completed deals
